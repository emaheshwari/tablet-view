            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an
                opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the
                world's
                active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure
                themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making bad
                decisions

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore, is along the southern shore of
                Lake Superior in
                Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly 100 miles of
                trails, everyone
                can find something to enjoy at Pictured Rocks! (source:
                https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)</p>
            <p>No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack,
                and camp
                (permit required). Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is from the water on
                a commercial
                boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to
                view the changing
                leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold
                weather brings
                otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing, skiing, and ice fishing are other
                popular winter
                activities. Check road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the winter. Spring: Go
                birding or walk
                the marsh trail! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: Asia</h3>
            <p>Harbin, often referred to as the "Ice City," is the capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern
                China. It has
                beautiful winter landscapes and Russian-influenced architecture, and the city serves as a major cultural
                and economic
                hub in the region. Established in the late 19th century as a fishing village near the Songhua River,
                Harbin quickly
                transformed into a vibrant cosmopolitan center, particularly due to the construction of the Eastern
                Chinese Railway by
                Russian engineers.</p>
            <p>Today, Harbin is most famous for its annual International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, where colossal
                ice sculptures
                and intricate snow art transform the city into a winter wonderland. Harbin is also famous for its unique
                Russian foods
                including the Russian sausages and beer. It is a unique blend of Chinese and Russian cultures.</p>

            <p>Seoul is the capital of South Korea and it is a city enshrined in history. The Han river runs through
                Seoul, dividing it
                into two parts. Additionally, there are many mountains in and around Seoul, making it so the city has a
                lot of hills.</p>
            <p>Seoul is the perfect blend of modern and historical with five royal palaces and several shrines.
                Additionally, there are
                plenty of fun shopping areas in Seoul such as Hongdae, Insadong, and Gangam. Lastly, Seoul is a city of
                cafes with one
                on almost every block and several fun cafe experiences to try out, especially in Yeonnam.</p>
