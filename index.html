            <img class="main-pic" width="400" src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that
                his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend
                that he doesn't
                see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
                skills in chasing
                them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will
                place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is
                also a lot of
                rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <img class="main-pic" width="400" src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">
            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and
                tries to get
                outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat
                tree and sleeping</p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like
                a rotisserie
                chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is
                about six years
                old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged</p>

            <h2>Milktea</h2>

            <img class="main-pic" width="400" src="images/Main.JPG" alt="Milktea taking nap">
            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat
                anything dropped
                on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud,
                distinguished manner. If
                what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has
                been empty for the
                3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”</p>
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon
                by humans. I
                highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2
                years old.
                Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even
                walk. She is living
                evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health</p>

            <img class="main-pic" width="400" src="images/rocky.jpg" alt="Black cat laying on red blanket">
            <p>Rocky is a 17 year old cat who enjoys spending his time laying around. He likes watching birds and trying
                to talk to
                them. While he loves birds from afar, he is not a fan of any other animals and enjoys terrorizing the
                dog, Oliver.</p>
            <p>Rocky is also a big fan of eating. He will do anything for a treat and likes any and all foods. He will
                gladly sneak
                onto the dinner table to sample any and all foods. If he doesn’t enjoy eating the food, Rocky is fine
                with playing with
                it instead.</p>

                alt="A black and white kitten sitting down and wearing a yellow collar.">
            <p>Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to
                Marquette, Michigan.
                He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy
                meals and a trip to
                the vet he is doing great!</p>
            <p>My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large
                house since we were
                previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he
                is sleepy he is
                happy to be held</p>
